                The Los Pollos Hermanos Story
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once a simple idea between two men as close as brothers, businessman Gustavo Fring and chef Maximino Arciniega sought to bring a delicious dream to life by opening a hole-in-the-wall fried chicken joint in Chile.
                The "Chicken Brothers," as they were known, didn't realize how big their little shop would become. Before they knew it, after raving success and thousands of customers every week, Gus and Max found that the restaurant had already bloomed into a finger-licking franchise that flew from place to place, eventually finding a nest in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
                With 14 locations roosting from the Land of Enchantment to Nevada, Los Pollos Hermanos combines that savory, spicy southwestern flavor you know and love with tender, farm-fresh chicken, delivered straight from our coops to your basket via our state-of-the-art cooling trucks.
                Slow-cooked to perfection, Los Pollos Hermanos is always trying to find something new for its loyal and valued customers to sink their teeth into. Serving lunch, dinner, snacks and sides, and catering for most events, Los Pollos Hermanos is still plucking strong.
                Come to Los Pollos Hermanos, where something delicious is always cooking.

                An anchor of the Albuquerque community, Gustavo "Gus" Fring co-founded Los Pollos Hermanos with his fellow Chicken Brother, Max Arciniega, decades ago in Chile.
                Mr. Fring spends his time deeply investing support in his local community, funding grants for hospitals and other medical institutions, donating money to early education institutions, running catering and fundraising events for local law enforcement, and meeting with his fellow leading community members for a backyard barbecue.
                He also funds a yearly scholarship for the University of New Mexico for promising and aspiring students studying in chemistry, dedicated to his dearly departed Chicken Brother.
                A modern renaissance man, the <i>pollolero</i> often works on the ground at his Albuquerque Pollos Hermanos location, greeting customers with a smile and his classic can-do attitude.
